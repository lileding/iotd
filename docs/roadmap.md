# IoTD Development Roadmap

## Overview

IoTD (IoT Daemon) development follows a progressive milestone approach, where each milestone builds upon the previous one, adding new features while maintaining backward compatibility. This incremental approach ensures a stable foundation while continuously expanding capabilities.

## Development Milestones

**✅ Completed Features:**
- ✅ Event-driven architecture with tokio::select! based packet handling
- ✅ Race-condition-free shutdown using CancellationToken across all components
- ✅ Half-connected session tracking with proper cleanup
- ✅ Stream deadlock prevention in packet handlers
- ✅ UNIX signal handling (SIGINT graceful shutdown, SIGTERM immediate exit)
- ✅ Multi-broker architecture with Server → Broker → Session hierarchy
- ✅ Session management with sessionId lifecycle (`__anon_$uuid` → `__client_$clientId`)
- ✅ Thread-safe operations using DashMap and Arc
- ✅ Transport abstraction layer for multiple protocols

**❌ Missing Core Features:**
- ❌ Clean session logic (handle `clean_session=false`)
